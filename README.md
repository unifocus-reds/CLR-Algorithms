Introduction to Algorithms

This is our first meeting to go over the first chapter of Introduction to Algorithm 3rd ed.  We will meet weekly on Tuesdays starting 2/6/2018.  In our first meeting we will go over recursion to make sure e/1 is comfortable with it as it will be needed for the code required to complete the Chapter 2 requirements.
